        <!-- A game created by David Perez, Samuel Stone, and Samuel Hipolito  -->
        Why many word when few word do trick...<br><br>
        You are a mage. You have <b>CARDS</b>. Your cards do stuff. You click the cards.
        The card does the thing. But you have 3 <b>MANA</b>.<br> Cards cost mana. You run out of mana.
        Your cards no work. But there is solution. You click <b>END TURN</b>. End turn refreshes mana.
        End turn rerolls cards. But now is enemy turn.<br> Enemy mad. Enemy hits you. The process continues.
        You die. You quit. <br><br>
        Then you realize. must play more to give better evaluation. This time you do better. This because you use <b>CAMPFIRES</b>.
        Campfire heal you. Or Campfires upgrade cards.<br> Upgrade cards = good. Not upgraded cards = less good.
        You also use <b>shop</b>. Shop lets you buy cards. Shop lets you remove cards. You are smart. You buy good cards. You remove bad cards.
        <br><br>
        You delve deeper. But you die again. You not strong enough. But next time new plan. New plan is more <b>ELITES</b>. Elites stronger monsters. Elites better rewards <br>
        You fight more elites. You become stronger. You win. Congratulations. Now grade game A...
        <br><br><br><br>
        Bad jokes aside, here are the kind of card types you may need to know.<br><br>
        <b>EXHAUST:</b> These cards will be consumed on use and will no longer reroll into the draw pile<br><br>
        <b>TEMPORARY: </b>These cards are usually added to the deck by other cards. They only last for the combat. <br><br>
        <b>ATTACK:</b> A reusable card (Unless it has Exhaust) that deals direct damage to an enemy and may have a secondary effect.<br><br>
        <b>SKILL:</b> A reusable card (Unless it has Exhaust) that has more unique effects to it. There isn't a clear direction with offensiveness and defensiveness unlike attacks.<br><br>
        <b>POWER:</b> A permanent upgrade for the entire combat encounter. Some Powers give flat stats like Strength or Dexterity. Others require<br> certain conditions to be met that combat. Each copy of a given power can only be played once per combat.
